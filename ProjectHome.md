# ABSTRACT #
**The intension of the project is to develop a building block to implement an extensive library which can be used in the scenario where users behind network address translators (NATs) are not able to establish TCP connections but are able to establish UDP connection. The main objective of the project is to implement a TCP-over-UDP (ToU) library in C/C++ language that provides socket-like APIs in which users can build connections that have almost the same congestion control, flow control, and connection control mechanism as offered by TCP. In this document, we present background concepts and architectures of implementing ToU library based on the IETF draft TCP-over-UDP [draft-baset-tsvwg-tcp-over-udp-01][1](1.md), and describe sample demonstrations for simple scenarios of a client and a server that are using ToU library. At the end, we also present our quantitative tests and analysis of ToU in comparison with real TCP Reno results, which we believe indicates that the ToU library is similar to real TCP Reno in terms of congestion window pattern in general network environments.**
